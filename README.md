Supercollider implementation of up-to-3-dimensional cellular automata in harmonic space

includes controls for rule type, dimension, grid size, timing, harmonic ratio multiple for individual axes, origin frequency, and even an arpeggiation function !

The hypothesis was that cellular automata would be an apt algorithm--and sound great--in harmonic space; since both cellular automata and the coherence of rational harmonic space hinge on neighbor states.
